Evolution of the Informational Complexity of Contemporary Western Music
=======================================================

This code was written to analyze the evolution of informational complexity of the Million Song Dataset (MSD) [1], using conditional entropy of codewords [2] as the measure of complexity.  The complexity of the overall MSD was compared with those songs found on the Billboard Hot 100 from [3].

The corresponding paper was accepted to the ISMIR 2019 conference and is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.04292 [4].
